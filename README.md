        <h1>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h1>

  <p>
  I'm <strong>MartÃ­n</strong>, a <strong>Fullstack Developer</strong> and a <strong>Systems Engineering student</strong>. I'm constantly learning and improving my skills in both frontend and backend development. My goal is to build user-friendly, scalable, and efficient applications while continuously exploring new technologies.
I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), focusing on building dynamic and high-performance web applications.
I enjoy problem-solving and tackling complex challenges, both in academic projects and real-world development. Currently, I'm focusing on expanding my knowledge in backend technologies, databases, and application architecture.
In my free time, I stay up to date with the latest trends in software development.
